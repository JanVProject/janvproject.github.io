      <h2>What does it mean to foster a child?</h2>
      <h3>
        In definition, fostering a child is taking care of a child for a limited
        time, without being the child's legal parents.
      </h3>
      <h2>What it actually means is much more important:</h2>
      <h3>
        Fostering a child means opening your heart to an often neglected and
        abused child and by offering your home to them, being a crucial part in
        their growing up. Even though they may not be your child, and they might
        only stay for a limtied period, the love foster parents feel for their
        foster children is irreplacable in their growing up and development.

      <h2>You care about children and are ready to help them</h2>
      <p>
        Many children within the foster care system, especially in foster homes
        have often been abused, neglected, forgotten, and have and continue to
        face challenges. Fostering children is a powerful way in lifting up
        children and showing them a path to a better life and future.

      <h2>You want to lower the pressure in foster homes</h2>
      <p>
        By fostering children at their youngest ages, parents are actually
        contributing to releasing pressure from foster homes and social care
        workers. By lowering the number of children in foster homes, those that
        must stay in foster homes will have a much more pleasent stay.

      <h2>
        You have enough space for older children and sibling groups and want to
        stop the breaking of the sibling bond
      </h2>
      <p>
        The bond between siblings is one of the longest and strongest
        relationships a person can have in their life. Croatia finds a very
        difficult time in finding enough space for siblings, which causes them
        to often be seperated. For children who have already experienced pain
        being taken away from parents, the separation from siblings is
        heart-breaking. By fostering children you will help protect those
        irreplacable bonds.

      <h2>You want to impact your community</h2>
      <p>
        Foster parenting goes much further than helping an individual child. Foster parents
        help fight the problems of homelessness, substance abuse, mental health issues,
        domestic abuse poverty and others. While caring for foster children, foster
        parents give the birth parents of the child the chance to receive the necessary
        help to overcome problems that may have led to the removal of the
        children from their home. Foster parents can also be role models to
        birth parents on better ways of parenting the children.
