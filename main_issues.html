      <h2>Lengthy stay in foster homes</h2>
      <p>
        Children arrive at foster homes very young, but many end up spending
        their entire childhoods in foster homes because of sometimes complicated
        proceedings and situations.

        Children have no place in institutions in the long run and this should
        just be a stopover.

      <h2>Many Croatian foster homes are overcrowded</h2>
      <p>
        Lack of privacy, a safe place to think, study and develop due to an ever
        so growing number of children in foster homes.

      <h2>Lack of family environment, closeness and stability.</h2>

      <p>
        Family is an irreplacable factor for children. Even though social care
        workers try to emulate a comfortable enviornment, many children lack
        stability and closeness and many times develop with different
        psychological problems and lackings.

      <h2>Long legal proceedings</h2>
      <p>
        Many times legal proceedings of deprivation of parental care can take
        more than 5 years, leaving children in foster homes exhausted and
        traumatisied by their parents' actions.

      <h2>Children are not the imperative in legal proceedings.</h2>
      <p>
        Often, children and their wishes are often disregarded and their parents
        are set as the imperative.

      <h2>Chance for chronic offences</h2>
      <p>
        According to many different statistics, young people who spent a
        significant period in foster homes are much more likely to commit
        offenses than those who do not.

      <h2>Complexity and longevity of the process</h2>
      <h3>
        Possible foster parents often get frightened by the process of becoming
        official foster parents due to its incredible complexity and longevity
        of process. Collecting, handling and delivering correct forms and
        documents can take months.

      <h2>Very small fees</h2>
      <p>
        In comparison to other developed EU countries, fees for fostering in
        Croatia are very small. Additionally, with rising inflation each year,
        these already small fees seem to diminish incredibly quickly.

        Even though many of these issues can only be solved by the Government
        and other institutions, Croatian citizens can play a major role in
        solving these issues.

      <h2>
        The long term solution to these issues is educating yourself, others and
        interesting in fostering.
